 ## Design

 No design rules was followed in particular but I ensured App [support different screen sizes](https://developer.android.com/training/multiscreen/screensizes) and the content has been adapted to fit for mobile devices. To do that, create a flexible layout using one or more of the following concepts:

 -   [Use constraintLayout](https://developer.android.com/training/multiscreen/screensizes#ConstraintLayout)
 -   [Avoid hard-coded layout sizes](https://developer.android.com/training/multiscreen/screensizes#TaskUseWrapMatchPar)

 ## Architecture

 The architecture of the application is based, apply and strictly complies with each of the following 4 points:

 -   A single-activity architecture, using the [Navigation component](https://developer.android.com/guide/navigation/navigation-getting-started) to manage fragment operations.
 -   [Android architecture components](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/), part of Android Jetpack for give to project a robust design, testable and maintainable.
 -   Pattern [Model-View-ViewModel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93viewmodel) (MVVM) facilitating a [separation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns) of development of the graphical user interface.
 -   [S.O.L.I.D](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID) design principles intended to make software designs more understandable, flexible and maintainable.

 ## Libraries

     -   [Jetpack](https://developer.android.com/jetpack):
     -   [Android KTX](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/ktx.html) - provide concise, idiomatic Kotlin to Jetpack and Android platform APIs.
     -   [AndroidX](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx) - major improvement to the original Android [Support Library](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/support-library/index), which is no longer maintained.
     -   [Data Binding](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/data-binding/) - allows you to bind UI components in your layouts to data sources in your app using a declarative format rather than programmatically.
     -   [ViewBinding](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/view-binding) - allows you to more easily write code that interacts with views.
     -   [Lifecycle](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/lifecycle) - perform actions in response to a change in the lifecycle status of another component, such as activities and fragments.
     -   [LiveData](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/livedata) - lifecycle-aware, meaning it respects the lifecycle of other app components, such as activities, fragments, or services.
     -   [Navigation](https://developer.android.com/guide/navigation/) - helps you implement navigation, from simple button clicks to more complex patterns, such as app bars and the navigation drawer.
     -   [ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel) - designed to store and manage UI-related data in a lifecycle conscious way. The ViewModel class allows data to survive configuration changes such as screen rotations.
 -   [Coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coroutines-overview.html) - managing background threads with simplified code and reducing needs for callbacks.
 -   [and more...]

     ### Test Libraries
     -   [Espresso](https://developer.android.com/training/testing/espresso) - to write concise, beautiful, and reliable Android UI tests
     -   [JUnit](https://github.com/junit-team/junit4) - a simple framework to write repeatable tests. It is an instance of the xUnit architecture for unit testing frameworks.
     -   [AndroidX](https://github.com/android/android-test) - the androidx test library provides an extensive framework for testing Android apps.

     ### Plugins
